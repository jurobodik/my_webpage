My nickname is Juro (pronounced like '€'), and I am a Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof. Valérie Chavez-Demoulin](https://wp.unil.ch/hecimpact/people/valerie-chavez-demoulin/) at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/hec/en/home.html) in Switzerland. I have been fortunate to collaborate with researchers across several institutions, including [Prof. Bin Yu](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yugroup/index.html) at UC Berkeley, where I spent six months as a visiting researcher in 2024, and [Prof. Shohei Shimizu](https://sites.google.com/view/sshimizu06/ss?authuser=0) at Osaka University, where I visited for a couple of months in 2025–26. I have also collaborated with colleagues at Stanford and the University of Geneva.

My research is rooted in mathematical statistics, with a focus on [causal inference](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/statistics/casual-inference) and its connections to probability theory and machine learning. I study how to reason about quantities that cannot be directly observed: counterfactuals, extreme events, and the hidden mechanisms connecting them. My current work centers on the identifiability of causal relations from observational data and the development of methods for causal discovery, where the goal is to uncover the underlying causal structure directly from data. I also connect causal inference with topics such as [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification), [extreme value theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory), and [time series analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality).

I was born in Slovakia and completed my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in pure mathematics at [Charles University](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en) in Prague, Czech Republic. During this period, I competed in and helped organize several international mathematical problem-solving [competitions](https://www.imc-math.org.uk/?year=2020&item=info). Back in Slovakia, I represented the [Slovak national team in the world championship in ultimate frisbee](https://wjuc2016.ultimatecentral.com/e/wfdf-2016-world-junior-ultimate-championships).
